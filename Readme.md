# HTML Object Printer, hop in short

  Hop is a small helpers collection for creating html objects such a hyperlinks, images or forms.

  I've created it while rewriting some webpage from PHP to Python. The one thing that was missing during the development process was a html object printer. So i decided to create a small one, with no dependencies, not related to any framework, KISS'ish etc. Perfect to use with any web-framework, from micros like bottle or fpyf to pylons, pyramid or django.
  Hop is actively maintained and used both in small and big commercial web applications. It's main goal is to bring easy to use html helper library that you can use in any python web projct, without worrying about compatibility or dependencies.

# Installation

  `$ easy_install hop` or `$ pip install hop`

# Documentation

  For now see `tests.py` for a helpers usage.

# Example

  Import hop.tags for direct access to all tags printers:
    
    import hop.tags as h

  then use it in views (for example Mako):

    <html>
        <head>
            ${h.title(u'My website')}
            ${h.charset()}
            ${h.script(u'/javascripts/jquery.js'}}
            ${h.style(u'/style.css'}}
        </head>
        <body>
            <p>${h.a(u'/albums', u'My albums')}</p>
            <p>${h.email(u'my@email.com', u'Mail me!')}</p>
            <div class="form">
                ${h.form(u'/handle/form', multipart=True)}
                    <p>${h.text(u'username')}</p>
                    <p>${h.password(u'password')}</p>
                    <p>${h.file(u'my_file')}</p>
                    <p>${h.radio_list(u'fav_movie', [u'matrix', u'casablanca', u'jasminum'])}</p>
                    <p>${h.checkbox(u'remember_me', checked=True)}</p>
                    <p>${h.submit(u'Submit')}</p>
                ${h.end_form()}
            </div>
            <p>
                <h2>I like:</h2>
                ${h.ul([u'banana', u'apple', u'juice'])}
            </p>
        </body>
    </html>
