HOP - Html Object Helper

Author: Micha≈Ç [balor] Thoma - http://balor.pl

HOP - a small helper class for creating html objects souch a hyperlinks, images or forms.

I've created it while rewriting some webpage from PHP (dead-simple inline scripts) to Python (Bottle + SqlAlchemy). 
The one thing that I've missed was some html object printer to be used in views. So i decided to create a small helper class, with no dependencies, not related to any framework, KISS'ish etc. Perfect to use with any simple web-framework like bottle or fpyf.

Features:
    - auto_form mothod for easy form creation
    - methods for custom html objects creation
    - methods for simplifying creation of most troublesome html objects: 
        links, 
        images, 
        lists,
        tables,
        script, 
        title, 
        style link, 
        meta charset, 
        html comment,
        form opening and closing,
        form input fields (text, hidden, textarea, select etc..),

Todo:
    - tests!
    - doc ?
