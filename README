HOP - Html Object Helper

Author: Micha≈Ç [balor] Thoma - http://balor.pl

HOP - a small helper class for creating html objects souch a hyperlinks, images or forms.

I've created it while rewriting some webpage from PHP (dead-simple inline scripts) to Python (Bottle + SqlAlchemy). 
The one thing that was missing and I couldn't find it was some html object printer to be used in views. I was using such a thing in some project using advanced frameworks with embedded html helpers and I remember them being helpful. So i decided to create a small helper class, with no dependencies, not related to any framework, KISS'ish etc. Perfect to use with any simple web-framework like bottle or fpyf.

Features:
    - autoForm mothod for easy form creation
    - methods for custom html objects creation
    - methods for simplifying creation of most troublesome tags: 
        a, 
        img, 
        script, 
        style link, 
        meta charset, 
        title, 
        input (different types and textarea, select to be done),
        form beginning and ending

Todo:
    - 'select' object in HOP.input method
    - table printer
    - list (ul,ol) printer
